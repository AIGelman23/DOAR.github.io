        <button class="accordion">Why do we assess student learning?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>To do assessment only for the goal of doing assessment and writing a report would be a waste of time. Instead, you should link your assessment practices to compelling, powerful, and consequential processes. You can link it to curriculum revisions, distance learning, retention, service learning, and improving student learning and teaching strategies.</p>
            <p>There is considerable evidence that assessment drives student learning and curriculum. Most importantly, our assessment tools tell our students what we consider to be important and make clear our expectations of what the student will do to be successful in the course or program. They will learn what we guide them to learn through our assessments. By using appropriate assessment techniques, we can encourage our student to raise the bar. Think of assessment for learning as the “learning process” where our students and we receive significant feedback to improve learning.</p>
            <p>It’s not always the assessments, but the changes they lead to, that are important. Change and innovation take courage, but they’re also at the heart of the teaching profession.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">I already give grades. Isn’t that assessment?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Not really. Assessment involves a sample of behavior from your student that can be observed and judged on the basis of specific criteria developed and assessed in multiple modes and contexts. For example, a project, presentation, a number of writing assignments, labs, and moreWe can’t just say that 73% of our students are getting As and Bs, so we must be doing okay. A letter grade itself does not give enough information about the learning that is occurring.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">How does assessment of learning help faculty?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>It provides teachers with useful information about their students, including the quality as learners and readiness for learning. Ongoing assessment informs the teachers about the pace and progress of student learning in their classroom.</p>
        </div>

        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Is student learning assessment something extra for me to do? Who should be doing this assessment?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>No, it’s not extra. You’re already assessing. It’s those learning opportunities that you have designed in your curriculum where you can give your students on-going feedback so that they can improve learning. Only faculty who guide the learning process can identify the student learning outcomes of that process, what it is they expect to happen to/for the student. It is the faculty who teach in that program, who can interpret the results, and recommend improvements in pedagogy and curriculum.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Does student assessment information results affect faculty evaluation?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>No. We’re focusing on the classroom level. Assessment is informed by the expertise and professional judgment of the faculty. Faculty in an academic department or program, interpreting the results of an assessment measure, might collectively decide to give more attention to certain outcomes, and might even recommend changes in pedagogy.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Are adjunct faculty involved in student learning assessment?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Yes, by all means. All faculty—full and part-time are involved in student learning, and therefore are expected to be involved in assessment. We have many creative and dedicated adjunct faculty at La Roche, and their contribution to assessment is valuable.</p>
        </div>


        <button class="accordion">What is the connection among the various levels of student learning assessment?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The focus of assessment is student learning. The most significant educational interaction happens between students and faculty in the classroom. The individual class section is part of a course, and courses are parts of programs. These levels reflect different, yet interrelated, facets of a student’s education.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">How will assessment improve learning?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Assessment is a tool; however, it is a tool by which we can communicate with our students about learning with learning opportunities and ongoing feedback. Assessment does not accomplish learning— but it provides information to the student and the faculty who may use it to improve learning.</p>
        </div>


        <button class="accordion">How does course-level assessment relate to program assessment, and how does program assessment fit in with the College’s overall assessment efforts?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Course-level assessment involves assessing student learning in a particular course. This can be accomplished using various assessment measures, which have corresponding targets and findings. This information is summarized each semester in the Course Assessment Template. It is an ongoing process with the primary purpose of improving course-level instruction and student learning.</p>
            <p>The information from Course Assessment Templates contributes to the overall program assessment, along with other program-level assessment measures. This program assessment is accomplished through an annual process where each program/discipline designs and implements an Assessment Plan, measures learning outcomes, analyzes the data collected, communicates the information, and uses these results to develop an action plan aimed at improving student learning.</p>
            <p>College assessment efforts include course-level assessment, program assessment, and assessment of general education. The goal of assessment of student learning at La Roche is to improve student learning and support the College in fulfilling its educational mission. Assessment provides evidence of how well La Roche is meeting its mission and helps identify areas for improvement.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">How many faculty of a given program should participate in the assessment process?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>All faculty, both full time and adjunct, should participate in assessment. All have a stake in the success of their respective program or discipline.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Where can I find additional information about assessment?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Resources are available on the intranet and on my.laroche.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">I still have a question. Who should I contact?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Please contact Laura Oknefski, M.Ed., Director of Retention and Assessment at 412-847-1812 or Laura.Oknefski@laroche.edu.</p>
